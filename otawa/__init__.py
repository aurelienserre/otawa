from . import costs
# replace by the following line once otawa transformed into package
# from otawa import costs
# (because module `otawa` will be in `sys.path` once installed as a package
# whereas for now, it's not in `sys.path` if we import from a parent directory
# which is not the one containing `otawa`, so we need to do a relative import,
# which seems not as clean)
# replace `otawa` by the name chosen for the package (otawacpd for example)
